# Wealth OS — v1.8.1

## Selective Privacy Mode

v1.8.1 narrows the eye-button privacy behavior so Wealth OS stays useful while sensitive balances are hidden.

### Hidden when Privacy Mode is ON

- Core Wealth
- Financial Net Worth
- Non-Core Funds
- CTBC, E.SUN, Cash Wallet and IBKR balances
- Emergency Fund and other goal balances
- regular income totals
- wealth-contribution totals and wealth-capacity figures
- sensitive month-end snapshot balances
- current/forecast wealth totals in Insights

### Always visible

- budget amounts and category caps
- actual category spending and remaining budget
- fixed-obligation amounts
- Activity transaction amounts
- expense history
- Spending Pace Insights, including expected-by-now, projected spend and safe daily spend
- Special Project/trip expense amounts and reimbursement tracking
- percentages, progress bars, dates and status indicators

This means Privacy Mode protects the size of your wealth and account balances without making normal budgeting, expense entry or project tracking difficult to use.
